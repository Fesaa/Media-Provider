# Webtoon (`webtoon`)

Media-Provider supports downloading manga's from webtoon.

You may add as many manga's as you want, but only one will be downloaded at a time, the rest is added in a queue. They will automatically start downloading after. Once a manga's has fully downloaded, Media-Provider wil zip them per chapter, into `.cbz` files with the following layout `Title Ch. ?.cbz`.
