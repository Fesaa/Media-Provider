# Subscriptions

As touched upon in [Usage](Usage.md), Media-Provider allows you to create subscriptions. Downloading content is great,
content automatically downloading without you having to do anything is even better. This where subscriptions come into play.

Only [Pasloe Providers](Pasloe.md) support subscribing to their content, consider using *arr apps for the rest. 

## Manage

After you've subscribed to content, it'll appear in your subscription manager, access it via your profile menu.

From here you can edit, delete or manually run your subscription if you really can't wait for the next chapter.

## Notifications

After a subscription has finished downloading, it'll leave a notification letting you know which chapters were downloaded.
If the subscription thinks it has downloaded all possible chapters, it'll also leave one so you can safely remove it.
Download errors, unexpected long load times also leave a notification. 

Recent download notifications are also left on the dashboard for easy viewing (when marked as unread).
