# Usage

Before you can start downloading content, you'll need to configure your pages. A page lets you search one or more providers,
and define filters for them. You can decide to load default pages included with the software, or start from scratch.

## Providers

Providers are the websites/services Media-Provider can use to get the content from. Each one can be set up with different
modifiers. See their respective documentation for details.

## Search results

Once you've found the content you'd like to acquire you have two options

<tabs>
    <tab title="Download">
        Download the content as a one-off. You can always decide where to save you download, and if you'd like to start it
        immediately. Some providers offer extra options while downloading. See their respective documentation for details.

    <tab title="Subscribe">
        Some providers also allow you to subscribe to their content. Media Provider will then periodically (daily, weekly, monthly).
        Check if the content has been updated, and download it for you.  All download options are available here as well.
