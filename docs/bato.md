# Bato (`bato`)

Media-Provider supports downloading manga's from Bato.

## Covers
Currently, Media-Provider does not include any covers when downloading from Bato.

## Tags

Same as dynasty, Bato has a LOT of tags. And most of them are rather weird. By default, Bato will not embed
any tags into the chapters ComicInfo.xml; you can choose to map some [tags to a genre](./preferences); and
mapping all other tags to the tag field when downloading a series.

## Config

Bato does have a few extra search options

- Genres (`genres`)
- Original language (`orig`)
- Translated language (`lang`)
- Publication status (`status`)
- Upload status (`upload`)
