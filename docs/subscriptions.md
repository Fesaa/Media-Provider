# Subscriptions

Some providers allow you to subscribe to their available content. After setting up on subscription, Media provider will periodically check if the provider has new content available for it. (I.e. new chapters on mangadex)


This is a fairly manual process,as you must provide the correct id yourself at the moment. There will be a hyperlink to double-check it.

## How it works

In the background the subscription will simply fake a download request to the selected provider.

## Supported providers
Very short, non-torrent providers that allow for checking already downloaded content.

- Mangadex
- Webtoon
- Dynasty (later)
