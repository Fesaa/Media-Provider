# Dashboard
 
The dashboard will display all currently running (i.e. downloading) content. 
And all content in the queue waiting to be downloaded. From here you will be able to

- Stop or cancel content
- View downloading content's progress
- Expected remaining time (not all providers support this)
- View directory structure of the download

The remaining time is simply the remaining ratio of the remaining size and current speed.
