# Downloading

After you've made a search request, you'll get a list of possible options to download. Depending on the provider, information for each option will be made available to you.
And a link to the providers webpage of the content will be available if supported.

To start downloading content, click the download button. This will open up a dialog,
which allows you to set some extra options. You may decide to prevent the content from
starting immediately. 

## Download location

The location to download into is set in the search form. See setup to configure directories.

## Download option

All providers support the `download immediately` option, for provider specific options, see their pages.
